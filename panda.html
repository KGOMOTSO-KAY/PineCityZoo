                   <h3>PANDA</h3>
                  <p>Giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) are large, gentle mammals native to the mountainous forests of central China. They are easily recognized by their distinctive black-and-white fur and are considered a national treasure in China. Although classified as carnivores, pandas have a diet that is over 99% bamboo, which they eat for up to 12 hours a day.</p>

<p>Pandas have strong jaws and large, flat molars that help them crush tough bamboo stalks. They also have a special wrist bone that functions like a thumb, helping them grasp bamboo while eating. Despite their size, pandas are skilled climbers and can swim well. They are generally solitary animals, with each adult maintaining a territory.</p>

<p>Pandas are known for their calm and peaceful nature. They communicate using vocal sounds, scent markings, and body language. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas were once endangered, but conservation efforts have helped improve their status to "vulnerable." They are now protected in nature reserves and breeding centers around the world.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the pandas at pen P02, near the bamboo forest exhibit and conservation zone.</p>
