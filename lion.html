                   <h3>LION</h3>
                   <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals belonging to the Felidae family. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are native to parts of Africa and a small region of India. They are the only big cats that live in social groups called prides, which usually consist of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. Lions are powerful predators with muscular bodies, sharp teeth, and strong jaws.</p>

<p>Male lions are easily recognized by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and help protect their necks during fights. Female lions, or lionesses, do most of the hunting for the pride. Lions are apex predators and primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras, antelope, and buffalo. They typically hunt in groups using teamwork and strategy.</p>

<p>Lions are mostly active at night and can sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy. Their loud roars can be heard from up to 8 kilometers away and are used to communicate and establish territory. Lions are listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, and they are protected in many reserves and national parks.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the lions at pen L01, near the big cat lookout and safari viewing area.</p>
