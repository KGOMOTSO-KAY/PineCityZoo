                   <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                   <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members of the pig family found in grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for their large, curved tusks, flat faces, and wart-like growths on the sides of their heads, which give them their name. These growths are actually protective pads that help during fights with other warthogs.</p>

<p>Warthogs have a stocky build, coarse hair, and a tufted tail that stands upright when they run. Despite their appearance, warthogs are fast and agile, capable of running at high speeds to escape predators. They often use abandoned burrows to sleep and shelter, entering them backward so they can quickly charge out if needed.</p>

<p>They are mainly herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and occasionally small insects or carrion. Warthogs are also known for kneeling on their front knees while grazing. They are social animals, usually found in small family groups called sounders. Warthogs play an important role in the ecosystem by turning up the soil as they forage.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the warthogs at pen W09, close to the savannah trail and meerkat lookout.</p>
