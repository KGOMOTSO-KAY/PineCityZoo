                   <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                   <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their exceptionally long necks and legs. They belong to the family Giraffidae and are found in various parts of Africa, particularly in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands. There are several subspecies of giraffes, each with unique coat patterns and geographic distributions.</p>

<p>A giraffe's long neck, which can be up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length, helps it reach leaves high up in trees, especially from acacia trees, which make up a large part of its diet. Despite their long necks, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—seven. Their unique spotted coat provides camouflage, and no two giraffes have the same pattern.</p>

<p>Giraffes are herbivores and spend most of their time feeding. They also have long, prehensile tongues—about 45 cm (18 inches) long—which help them grasp and strip leaves from branches. Giraffes live in loose herds and are generally gentle and social animals. Their long legs allow them to run up to 60 km/h (37 mph) over short distances.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G08, near the tall tree enclosure and observation deck.</p>
