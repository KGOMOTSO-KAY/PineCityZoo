                   <h3>KOALA</h3>
                   <p>Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia. Although they are often called "koala bears," they are not bears at all. Koalas belong to a group of mammals known as marsupials, which carry and nurse their young in pouches. They are most commonly found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia.</p>

<p>Koalas have thick, grey fur with a white chest, a large black nose, and fluffy ears. They have strong limbs and sharp claws, which help them climb and grip onto trees. Koalas sleep for up to 20 hours a day due to their low-energy diet, which consists almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves. These leaves are tough, toxic to most animals, and low in nutrition, but koalas have a special digestive system to process them.</p>

<p>Koalas are solitary and territorial animals. They communicate using a range of vocalizations, including loud bellows during mating season. Because of habitat loss and bushfires, koalas are considered a vulnerable species and are protected by law in many parts of Australia.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen K05, near the eucalyptus garden and reptile house.</p>
