                   <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                   <p>Gorillas are large, ground-dwelling primates that belong to the family Hominidae, which also includes humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. They are the largest living primates and are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), each with further subspecies. Gorillas are native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa and live in dense tropical jungles and lowland swamps.</p>

<p>Gorillas have broad chests, muscular arms, and dark, thick fur. Adult males are known as silverbacks due to the silver hair that grows across their backs as they mature. They walk on all fours using their knuckles and are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. Gorillas are intelligent creatures capable of using tools and displaying emotions such as joy, sadness, and affection.</p>

<p>Gorillas live in family groups led by a dominant silverback male, who protects and guides the group. They are generally peaceful but can be very strong and protective when threatened. Due to habitat loss, disease, and poaching, gorillas are considered endangered, and several conservation efforts are in place to protect them.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the gorillas at pen G20, near the rainforest enclosure and primate research center.</p>
