                   <h3>GEMBOK</h3>
                   <p>The springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) is a medium-sized antelope found mainly in southern and southwestern Africa. It is the national animal of South Africa. Springboks are known for their striking appearance with a light brown body, white underbelly, and a dark brown stripe that runs along each side. They belong to the Bovidae family and are closely related to gazelles.</p>

<p>Springboks are best known for their unique behavior called "pronking" or "stotting," where they leap into the air with an arched back and stiff legs. This may be used to startle predators or display fitness. Both males and females have curved, lyre-shaped horns, although the males' horns are usually thicker and longer.</p>

<p>These animals are herbivores and graze primarily on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. They inhabit dry, open plains and arid regions such as the Karoo and Kalahari deserts. Springboks can survive in harsh environments and are able to go without drinking water for long periods, deriving moisture from the plants they eat.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You will find the springboks at pen G14, near the main entrance and picnic area.</p>
